# Frontend Mentor Challenge - Designo

This repository contains my solution to the Designo challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge involved building a
landing page for a design agency called Designo. I used Next.js and TypeScript along with Styled Components to complete
this project as a way to learn and practice these technologies.

## Features

- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices (375px / 768px / 1440px).
- Interactive elements to enhance user experience.
- Usage of Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- Implementation of TypeScript for static typing and improved code quality.
- Utilization of Styled Components for styling the components and layout of the landing page.
- Email.js integration for handling contact form submissions and sending emails.
- Integration of React Leaflet for interactive and customizable maps.
